# Track-Zone

## A Time Zone Management Web App for Freelancers and Developers

## Description

Track-Zone is a web application designed to assist developers and freelancers in managing time across multiple time zones. Users can create and manage clocks for various time zones, making it easier to coordinate with international teams or clients. Developed as part of the Full Stack Army course by Stack Learner, this project showcases frontend development skills with potential backend integration.

## Features

- Create and manage multiple clocks for different time zones
- Set custom time zones or select from predefined options
- Display time differences between clocks
- (Optional) Set events or reminders for specific time zones (if implemented)

## Technologies Used

| Component       | Technology                     |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| **Frontend**    | React.js            |
